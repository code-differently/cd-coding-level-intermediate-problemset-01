       We need you to make ___ amount of copies of a given string.
       A string will be given and a non-negative number.
       We need you to make the given number of copies of the original string.

       Return a larger string that has n copies of the given string.

       Example:
       stringCopies("Hi", 2) --> "HiHi"

       stringCopies("Hi", 1) --> "Hi"

    Does the given string contain a first instance of "x" immediately followed by another "x"?
    Evaulate the given string and return true if the first seen "x" is followed right by another "x".

    Provided a given string, take note of how many times you see a substring length 2 occur.

    Also, the last 2 characters of the string, such as "hixxxhi" would yield 1; don't count the end substring.

    subTwo("hixxhi") --> 1
    subTwo("xaxxaxaxx") --> 1

    /* Problem 04
    The new elementary school teacher wants to make a fun interactive way of learning the basic numbers.
    She wants to start with learning 1,2,3, but she is providing sets of numbers for the kids to find 1, 2, 3 out of.
    The sets of numbers will be given in a array for you to decided if they contain the sequence 1,2,3 anywhere within the
    array.

    Return true if the sequence of numbers 1, 2, 3 appears in the array anywhere.

    Example:
    basicNumbers123([1, 1, 2, 3, 1]) --> true
    basicNumbers123([1, 1, 2, 4, 1]) --> false
    basicNumbers123([1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]) --> true

    Lets play a game of scramble the letters of any given word.
    A string will be given to you, and we need you to create a new string where we will only ask for specific letters
    out of the string.

    Return a new string made of characters at indexes 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9.

    So "kittens" will yield "kien".

    For this special case, were going to say that during a game of basketball a "triple" is when someone scores the same
    point value 3 times in a row. Such as, scoring 2 points three times in a row.
    We are keeping track of players point values in an array, but we don't want you to accept any player who has "triples".
